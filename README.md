# Zamato Dataset

* The Zomato dataset is a comprehensive collection of restaurant-related information sourced from the popular online food delivery and restaurant discovery platform, Zomato. It includes restaurant names, locations, cuisines, user ratings, average cost for two people, online delivery availability, table booking options, and much more.

* I have examined the distribution of restaurants across different countries and cities, including aspects such as online delivery and table booking availability. I also explored the popularity of various cuisines among users and analyzed the average cost for two people dining in different regions. 
Furthermore, I assessed the average user ratings and visualized them to gain a deeper understanding of the overall restaurant quality, along with many other key performance indicators.
